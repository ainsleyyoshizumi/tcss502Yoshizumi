It took me roughly three days to finish this assignment where each day I worked on it for at least two hours, one of the days I worked on it for at least four hours. It took a long time to understand the implementation. My issues were in testing, I had a hard time debugging and just initially trying to figure out what each test was doing and what my code was doing at times. Overall, I learned a lot about debugging this assignment than I did with using classes, it was challenging but rewarding once I got everything to pass all the tests.
